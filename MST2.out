Welcome to the MST Test Program
Testing the Default Scenario
This is an empty graph - No MST
Testing the file data
The file name for the graph data: CIS-Land2.dat
A graph with 6 and 7 will be created
The number of input edges to process is: 7
Edge Added: 0, 1, 4

Edge Added: 2, 3, 4
Edge Added: 3, 2, 4
Edge Added: 1, 3, 2
Edge Added: 3, 1, 2
Edge Added: 0, 2, 3
Edge Added: 2, 0, 3
Edge Added: 4, 5, 6
Edge Added: 5, 4, 6
