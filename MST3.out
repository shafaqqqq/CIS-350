Welcome to the MST Test Program
Testing the Default Scenario
This is an empty graph - No MST
Testing the file data
The file name for the graph data: CIS-Land3.dat
A graph with 6 and 16 will be created
The number of input edges to process is: 16
Edge Added: 0, 1, 1
Edge Added: 1, 0, 1
Edge Added: 1, 3, 5
Edge Added: 3, 1, 5
This is an invalid source or destination vortex - Cannot add edge: -3, 1, 4 - Request ignored
Edge Added: 3, 0, 3
Edge Added: 0, 3, 3
Edge Added: 3, 4, 1
Edge Added: 4, 3, 1
This is an invalid source or destination vortex - Cannot add edge: 6, 1, 6 - Request ignored
Edge Added: 1, 4, 1
Edge Added: 4, 1, 1
This is an invalid source or destination vortex - Cannot add edge: 1, -3, 4 - Request ignored
This is an invalid weight - Cannot add edge: 2, 4, 0 - Request ignored
Edge Added: 1, 2, 6
Edge Added: 2, 1, 6
Edge Added: 5, 2, 2
Edge Added: 2, 5, 2
This is an invalid weight - Cannot add edge: 2, 4, -3 - Request ignored
Edge Added: 2, 4, 4
Edge Added: 4, 2, 4
This is an invalid source or destination vortex - Cannot add edge: 5, 14, 5 - Request ignored
Edge Added: 5, 4, 4
Edge Added: 4, 5, 4
This is an invalid source or destination vortex - Cannot add edge: 15, 3, 7 - Request ignored
