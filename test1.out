Welcome to the MST Test Program
Testing the Default Scenario
This is an empty graph - No MST
Testing the file data
The file name for the graph data: test1.dat
A graph with 2 and 1 will be created
The number of input edges to process is: 1
Edge Added: 0, 1, 7
Edge Added: 1, 0, 7
Full Graph - Adjacency List
Adj[0] -> (1, 7)
Adj[1] -> (0, 7)
Minimum Spanning Tree
Edge: 1 - 0 weight: 7
Total cost of MST: 7
MST Graph - Adjacency List
Adj[0] -> (1, 7)
Adj[1] -> (0, 7)
Thank you for running the MST Test Program written by Shafaq Alhusseini!
