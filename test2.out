Welcome to the MST Test Program
Testing the Default Scenario
This is an empty graph - No MST
Testing the file data
The file name for the graph data: test2.dat
A graph with 5 and 6 will be created
The number of input edges to process is: 6
Edge Added: 0, 1, 2
Edge Added: 1, 0, 2
Edge Added: 0, 2, 3
Edge Added: 2, 0, 3
Edge Added: 1, 2, 1
Edge Added: 2, 1, 1
Edge Added: 1, 3, 4
Edge Added: 3, 1, 4
Edge Added: 2, 4, 5
Edge Added: 4, 2, 5
Edge Added: 3, 4, 7
Edge Added: 4, 3, 7
Full Graph - Adjacency List
Adj[0] -> (1, 2) (2, 3)
Adj[1] -> (0, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4)
Adj[2] -> (0, 3) (1, 1) (4, 5)
Adj[3] -> (1, 4) (4, 7)
Adj[4] -> (2, 5) (3, 7)
Minimum Spanning Tree
Edge: 1 - 0 weight: 2
Edge: 2 - 1 weight: 1
Edge: 3 - 1 weight: 4
Edge: 4 - 2 weight: 5
Total cost of MST: 12
